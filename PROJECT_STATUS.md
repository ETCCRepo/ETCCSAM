# SAM Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-09-14 — **checkpoint v6.9**: removed the "Member Database" modal on the Registrations screen after confirming (by grepping every `onclick` in `index.html`) it had **no UI entry point anywhere** — its own HTML/JS was fully built but nothing ever called `showMemberDBModal()`. Added an **Import History** log to Developer > Import Members instead: each CSV import now appends a `{timestamp, count}` entry to a new `sam_members_import_history` key, shown in its own card, deliberately separate from `sam_members` so the log survives a member-list "Delete All". This is on top of the same-day v6.7/v6.8 session below (Bid Sheet duplex layout) — **still the more consequential read if you're about to touch `printBiddingSheets()`**.

This file exists so a brand-new Claude Code session can resume this work with zero prior conversation context. Read this alongside `CLAUDE.md` (architecture/rules) before touching code.

---

## Current state (as of this doc)

- **Deployed version:** **v6.9** (`index.html` footer `#app-version`) — deployed code matches the latest checkpoint commit, no drift.
- **Git:** `main` branch, last commit `9a1deb5` ("Checkpoint v6.9: remove dead Member Database modal, add member Import History"), pushed to `origin` (https://github.com/ETCCRepo/ETCCSAM.git). Working tree is clean.
- **Regression suite (`test.html`) was updated this session and confirmed green by the user** before the v6.9 checkpoint.
- **No uncommitted app-code work** as of this doc.
- **New in v6.9:** the Registrations screen's Member Database modal is **gone** (was already orphaned, confirmed and removed — see open item #15). Developer > Import Members has a new **Import History** card. See that same open item before assuming the old modal/walk-in-from-roster flow still exists.
- **⚠️ `deploy.ps1` deploy mechanism changed in the v6.7/v6.8 session — read before assuming curl-based troubleshooting advice from older sessions still applies.** It now uses `System.Net.FtpWebRequest` instead of `curl.exe`. See open item #14 below.
- **Note on version bumping earlier in this multi-day arc:** `/ETCCSAMCheckpoint v6.0` (an explicit version argument) was correctly interpreted as a requested major bump. Later, `/ETCCSAMCheckpoint` (no argument) was run and a major bump to v7.0 was applied by mistake — caught and reverted to v6.3 (correct minor bump) before committing; no v7.0 was ever pushed or deployed. Worth knowing only so version history's lack of a v7.0 gap isn't a mystery later.

### ⚠️ Open items carried into the next session

1. **The settings-password "corrupted again" investigation from several sessions ago is still not conclusively closed.** The working theory (a transcription/autofill issue at the password prompt, not a code bug) was never confirmed. If it resurfaces, start by asking whether the bypass test was ever tried, rather than re-diagnosing from scratch.
2. **`api.php`/`add-item.php` deploys via `deploy.ps1` have been intermittently unreliable in past sessions** (`curl: (56)`/`curl: (18) ... got 450`) — manual upload via Hostinger File Manager is the fallback that has worked. This session's deploys (including `.php` files) all reported success first try, but keep verifying with a diff/marker check if one ever looks suspicious.
3. **The Gmail-scan workflow's UI is hidden (`display:none`), not deleted**, and a large amount of supporting JS remains in `index.html`, unreferenced by any visible UI. Couldn't be fully removed because the **Gmail OAuth Settings card is still load-bearing** for **Announce Winners → Email Winners** (`sendWinnerEmails()` → `sendEmailsViaGmail()`).
4. **`donate-item.php` remains fully removed** — `add-item.php` is the only item-donation entry point. Its old SQL-side backend is still there in `api.php`, unused, per the "flag, don't delete" convention.
5. **`starting-bid-list.php` has no password gate**, matching `add-item.php`'s convention — anyone with the URL can view the full donated-items list with donor names and starting bids. Not explicitly discussed as a security tradeoff; flag it if the club raises privacy concerns.
6. **⚠️ Bid sheet algorithm — read this before changing `printBiddingSheets()` or `starting-bid-list.php`.** The two computations live in different files/languages (`index.html` JS, `starting-bid-list.php` PHP) and must be kept in sync — a header comment in the PHP file cross-references the JS function. The **current, final rule** (as of v6.3, unchanged in v6.4): every item is either an **OPEN auction** (Item Value alone — never reserve — is ≤ Settings → Auction Setup → "Open Bids", default $35) or a **PREMIUM auction** (Value above that). OPEN preprints only the first bid (reserve if set, else $1) with blank rows after; PREMIUM preprints all 20 rows, first bid = reserve if set else 30% of Value, increment = 10% of Value if Value < $100 else 7% if Value ≥ $100 (bracket boundary is `>=`, not `>` — a real bug fixed this session). **Reserve never decides OPEN vs. PREMIUM membership** — a mid-session revision briefly let a low reserve make an expensive item OPEN, and it shipped in v6.2 before a real bug report (item 800-1: Value $50/Reserve $25 printing a blank sheet) reversed it back to Value-alone in v6.3. `test.html` has a suite specifically documenting that reversal so it isn't accidentally resurrected from old commit history or a stale conversation summary.
7. **PHP files cannot be syntax-checked locally** — `php` is not on PATH in this environment (`php -l` fails with "command not found"). Edits to `.php` files are verified by inspection only, then confirmed by loading the live page. PHP 8's nested-ternary parenthesization requirement has bitten this project before — watch for it.
8. **A near-duplicate of `add-item.php` was created and fully removed in the v5.1 session** (`silent-auction-form.php`). If a future request sounds like "a public item-donation form without the member picker," check that session's history first.
9. **The "Bidders: 17 vs. 25" Home/Registrations mismatch (v5.4 session) was explained but never confirmed fixed.** Not touched again this session — still open if it resurfaces.
10. **Bid sheet row height is now `BID_SHEET_ROW_HEIGHT_IN = 0.40` in `printBiddingSheets()`**, a hardcoded JS constant with no UI to change it (the v3.1-era per-item override column and toolbar control were both removed this session). If a future request wants it configurable again, that's new work, not a revert — the old mechanism (`updateItemRowHeight()`, `#bs-row-height-input`, the per-item cascade-on-change logic) no longer exists in the codebase at all, only in git history.
11. **Two donor-name overflow bugs and one table-height bug were found by the user reviewing live screens this session** (not from code review) — worth remembering that pattern: `#items-table`'s fix didn't automatically cover `#bs-items-table` because they have entirely separate row-rendering functions (`refreshItemsTable()` vs. `refreshBsItemsTable()`), and the Registrations table's `calc(100vh - 388px)` was a silent outlier compared to every sibling screen's `calc(100vh - 278px)`. If another table shows a similar overflow or excessive-whitespace symptom, check for this same "fix applied to one twin table but not the other" pattern first.
12. **⚠️ Donated Items row editing changed shape in v6.6 — the old in-row Edit button is gone.** Double-clicking a row now opens `#item-edit-modal` (`openItemEditModal()`/`saveItemEditModal()`/`closeItemEditModal()`, all in `index.html`). The Actions column (View/Edit buttons) was removed from `#items-table` entirely. The **old in-row editor is flagged ORPHANED, not deleted** — `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`, `rowCheckboxOffset()`, `editItemByNumber()`, `saveItemEdit()`, `cancelItemEdit()` all still exist (with a comment block explaining why, right above `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`) but have **no live callers** as of this doc. Do not assume `editItemByNumber()` is reachable from the UI — it isn't. If reviving in-row editing is ever requested, that code is still there to resurrect; if extending item-editing, extend `saveItemEditModal()` instead. Note also that the modal's rename-a-winner-record-when-Item-#-changes handling is new in v6.6 and does **not** exist in the orphaned `saveItemEdit()`, in case that old code path is ever revived without noticing the gap.
13. **⚠️ Bid Sheet duplex layout & row-height saga (v6.7/v6.8) — read before touching `printBiddingSheets()`'s layout constants.** Each printed item now emits **4 page `<div>`s in this order**: `.sheet` (page 1 front, the original 20-row bid table + description/info boxes), `.sheet.sheet-continuation` (page 1 back, a new continuation bid table with **no** description/info boxes), `.label-page` (page 2 front, the description/donor label — unchanged from before), `.blank-page` (page 2 back, empty). With a printer set to duplex, this pairs correctly; **the app cannot force a printer/browser print dialog into duplex mode or a specific scale/margins setting** — no web API exposes that, it's entirely OS/driver-level. Two constants govern the fit and are **coupled**, not independent: `BID_SHEET_ROW_HEIGHT_IN` (currently `0.40`) sets every row's height on both the front and continuation tables, and `continuationRowCount` (currently `23`) sets how many rows the continuation page gets — since that page has no info boxes above the table, it can (and must, to fill the page) hold more rows than page 1's fixed `bidCount = 20`, but the exact number has to be recalculated any time the row height changes, or the continuation table overflows onto page 2's front (confirmed by a real screenshot this session). **What actually happened, in order:** (a) row height was `0.40` going in; (b) a screenshot showed only 16-17 of 20 rows fitting on page 1, so row height was shrunk to `0.35` then `0.28`, and `.sheet` padding shrunk `0.12in→0.05in`, to compensate; (c) the *real* root cause turned out to be the "Bid Amount" `<th>` silently wrapping to two lines ("Bid"/"Amount"), taking more vertical space than assumed — fixed properly with `white-space: nowrap` on `.bid-table th`; (d) separately, the user's own print-dialog **scale setting was also wrong** at the time of the overflow screenshots, compounding the apparent problem; (e) once both the header-wrap bug and the user's scaling were fixed, row height and `.sheet` padding were reverted back to their original `0.40`/`0.12in` values, since the row-height shrink was never actually necessary; (f) `continuationRowCount`, which had been set to `26` to fill the page at the smaller `0.28in` rows, then overflowed onto page 2 once rows went back to `0.40in` — reduced to `23` (confirmed via a real print screenshot showing the overflow, then confirmed fixed). **If asked to change row height again, remember to recompute `continuationRowCount` too** — there's no automatic scaling between the two, they're independent literals in the same function (`printBiddingSheets()`, `index.html`).
14. **`deploy.ps1`'s FTP transport was replaced this session — `curl.exe` is no longer used at all.** Root cause: on this machine, `curl.exe` uses the Windows Schannel TLS backend, which has a bug against this host's FTPS server — the file transfers **completely** (100% of bytes sent, confirmed via `curl -v` trace), but curl fails to read the server's final "226 Transfer complete" response over the control channel and exits with code 56 (`response reading failed`). The dangerous part: **this looked like a normal transient failure** (`deploy.ps1` printed "FAILED" with the curl error), but retrying the exact same command 3-5 times in a row all failed *identically* while `Last-Modified` on the live file never changed — meaning **every one of those retries had silently not deployed anything**, despite the appearance of a real attempt each time. `Deploy-File` in `deploy.ps1` now uses `System.Net.FtpWebRequest` instead, with a new `New-RemoteDir` helper recreating curl's old `--ftp-create-dirs` auto-directory-creation behavior, and a 300ms `Start-Sleep` between files in full-deploy mode (rapid back-to-back connections briefly triggered a real, transient `450 File unavailable (file busy)` from the host — confirmed to succeed instantly on individual retry, unlike the curl issue). This was verified end-to-end: single-file mode, full-deploy mode (all files, including nested `backend/routes/*.js`), and repeated `Last-Modified`-header checks confirming every "OK" now corresponds to a real change on the server. **If a future deploy ever reports failure, don't assume it's the old curl bug** — that transport is gone; a `FtpWebRequest` exception means something else (credentials, network, actual server rejection) and should be investigated fresh, not worked around via manual `.NET` scripting like this session's `/tmp/ftpupload.ps1` had to do before the permanent fix landed.
15. **⚠️ The Registrations screen's "Member Database" modal is gone as of v6.9 — do not assume the walk-in-from-roster flow still exists.** `showMemberDBModal()`/`closeMemberDBModal()`/`selectAllMembers()`/`filterMemberTable()`/`addCheckedToWalkins()` and the `#member-db-modal` HTML/CSS were **deleted outright**, not flagged-and-kept — confirmed via grep that no button anywhere called `showMemberDBModal()` before removing it (unlike the in-row-edit cluster in item #12, which is still flagged-but-kept because its orphaning was more recent/less certain). If a future request wants "search the member roster and add someone as a walk-in bidder" back, that's new work from scratch, not a revert — the code no longer exists in the file at all, only in git history before commit `9a1deb5`. Two things that still legitimately read `sam_members`/`DB.getMembers()` and were left alone: `loadSettingsForm()`/`refreshImportMembersTable()` (read-only display) and `add-item.php`'s independent "ETCC Member Name" dropdown (a separate file). Also new in v6.9: a **member Import History log** (`sam_members_import_history`, a new localStorage key, auto-synced like every other `sam_`-prefixed key) — each CSV import via `importMembersCsv()` now appends a `{timestamp, count}` entry, rendered in its own card on the Import Members screen, deliberately untouched by "Delete All" so the log outlives a member-list clear. No cap or manual-clear control exists on this log yet (unbounded growth, accepted for now — imports are infrequent).

---

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.9)

Two threads, both starting from a plain question the user asked while reviewing the app: "is the members table used by the website other than the import."

### 1. Investigation — members table usage, and a real orphaned-code find
Grepped every call site of `DB.getMembers()`/`sam_members` across `index.html`, `api.php`, and `add-item.php`. Found four consumers, reported back to the user, and one of them turned out to be dead:
- **`add-item.php`** — genuinely active, reads `sam_members` live for its "ETCC Member Name" dropdown.
- **`loadSettingsForm()`** and **`refreshImportMembersTable()`** — read-only status/list display, not really "using" the data functionally.
- **The in-app "Member Database" modal** (`showMemberDBModal()` and friends) — code fully built out (search box, roster table, "Add to Bidders" button), but grepping every `onclick` in the file turned up **no button anywhere that ever called `showMemberDBModal()`**. It was unreachable from the UI. Interestingly, `add-item.php`'s own code comment already called this screen "(now-orphaned)" — a past session apparently knew, but the code itself was never cleaned up or logged in this doc.

### 2. Removed — the dead Member Database modal
Per explicit user request ("remove dead modal code") once the finding above was confirmed. Deleted outright (not flagged-and-kept, since it was genuinely unreachable, unlike the in-row-edit cluster from v6.6 which stayed flagged):
- CSS: `#member-db-modal`/`#member-db-modal-table` rules.
- HTML: the whole modal block (search input, roster table, Add to Bidders / Clear / Close buttons).
- JS: `closeMemberDBModal()`, `showMemberDBModal()`, `selectAllMembers()`, `filterMemberTable()`, `addCheckedToWalkins()`.
- A dangling refresh-check left in the "Clear Members" Developer Tools button handler (`if (typeof showMemberDBModal === 'function' && ...) showMemberDBModal();`) — harmless once the modal was gone (the `typeof` guard made it a no-op), but removed rather than left as dead code referencing dead code.

Left alone: the four legitimate consumers listed above, and a **second, separately-already-orphaned** `importMemberCSV()` function (differently cased from the live `importMembersCsv()`) targeting a `#inp-member-csv` field that doesn't exist in any visible screen — it already carried its own "removed from the UI in v4.0 but left" comment and wasn't touched.

### 3. New feature — member Import History log
Follow-up request after seeing the Import Members screen (372 imported members, a destructive "Importing replaces the entire member list" warning already in the UI copy, no record of past imports). Added:
- `DB.getMemberImportHistory()` / `DB.addMemberImportHistoryEntry(count)` — a new `sam_members_import_history` localStorage key, read/written with plain `getItem`/`setItem` calls. No new API action needed: any `sam_`-prefixed key already auto-syncs to the server via the existing global `localStorage.setItem` wrapper's `action:'set'` call.
- `importMembersCsv()` (the live, UI-wired import function) now calls `addMemberImportHistoryEntry(members.length)` right after `DB.saveMembers(members)`.
- A new **"Import History"** card on the Import Members screen, between the CSV upload form and the current member-list card — Date/Time and Members Imported columns, newest first (`unshift()`, not `push()`).
- **Deliberately separate from `sam_members` itself** — `clearImportedMembers()` ("Delete All") never touches the history key, so the log survives a member-list clear. That's the entire point of "keep history": it's a persistent log of import *events*, not a second copy of the current roster.
- **Known limitation, not addressed this session:** no cap and no manual "Clear History" control — the log grows unbounded. Flagged to the user directly rather than silently designed around; acceptable for now since imports happen only a handful of times per auction cycle.

### 4. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
Two new suites: `'Registrations — dead Member Database modal removed (this session)'` (3 assertions covering the full removal, the dangling-handler cleanup, and that legitimate consumers were untouched) and `'Import Members — Import History log (this session)'` (7 assertions, including executable checks — via a local mirror of the prepend logic — that history entries accumulate rather than overwrite, and that new entries land newest-first).

### 5. Checkpoint v6.9 (minor version bump)
Run via `/ETCCSAMAll`, which chains `/ETCCSAMCheckpoint` then `/ETCCSAMEnd`. Mid-checkpoint, the user asked "change log is not updated" — this was expected, not a bug: the in-app Change Log screen (`loadChangelog()`) pulls commit history live from GitHub, so it naturally showed nothing until this session's work was actually committed and pushed. Minor bump from v6.8 via `.\bump-version.ps1` (no `-Major` requested).

### Files touched this session
| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | committed (`9a1deb5`) | Member Database modal fully removed (CSS/HTML/5 JS functions + dangling handler reference); new Import History log (`DB.getMemberImportHistory()`/`addMemberImportHistoryEntry()`, wired into `importMembersCsv()`, new UI card + `refreshImportHistoryTable()`); version bump to v6.9 |
| `test.html` | committed (`9a1deb5`) | 2 new suites / 10 assertions, including executable prepend-logic checks. Confirmed green by the user. |

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoints v6.7, v6.8)

New day, new topic from the v6.6 session above — Print Bid Sheets' output layout, driven entirely by real print screenshots the user sent along the way, plus an unrelated but important deploy-tooling fix discovered mid-session.

### 1. New feature — Print Bid Sheets goes from 2 pages/item to 4-page duplex layout
**Request:** "Print 2 double sided pages. Page 1 side 1 as it currently is. Page 1 side 2 fill with 20+ rows. Page 2 side 1: the current page 2. Page 2 side 2: blank page."

Implemented in `printBiddingSheets()` (`index.html`): each item's HTML block now emits 4 page `<div>`s in order — `.sheet` (unchanged page-1-front bid table), a new `.sheet.sheet-continuation` (page-1-back — bid table only, no description/info boxes, header reads "Item # X (continued)"), `.label-page` (unchanged page-2-front description/donor page), and a new empty `.blank-page` (page-2-back). With a printer set to duplex, sides pair up correctly. The bid-amount ladder (Premium items) was made continuous across both bid tables: `bidAmounts` now generates `bidCount + continuationRowCount` values in one loop (so `prevAmt`/ascending-dedup logic runs unbroken), then splits into `bidRows`/`bidRows2` by slicing. Open-bid items correctly leave every continuation row blank too (`mkBidRow(amt, idx)` blanks any row where `isOpenBid && idx > 0`, and continuation rows pass `idx = i + bidCount` so they're always `> 0`).

Initial continuation row count was `26` (chosen when row height was `0.28in`, see below) — reduced to `23` after row height reverted to `0.40in`, once a real print screenshot showed the continuation table overflowing onto page 2's front at the taller row height.

### 2. Real bug — "Bid Amount" header silently wrapping to two lines, plus row-height back-and-forth
**Symptom (from a screenshot):** only ~16-17 of the intended 20 rows fit on page 1 before overflowing onto the next physical page.

**What happened, in order (see open item #13 above for the full narrative):**
1. Assumed the fixed `BID_SHEET_ROW_HEIGHT_IN` (was `0.40`) was simply too tall for the page budget — shrunk it to `0.35`, still overflowed per a second screenshot (17 of 20 rows), shrunk further to `0.28`, plus `.sheet` padding `0.12in→0.05in` to reclaim more space. This "worked" (all 20 rows fit) but left a lot of unused blank space at the bottom of the page.
2. Later, the user reported their **print-dialog scale setting had been wrong** and asked to "fix layout" now that scaling was corrected. Re-examining the screenshots at that point pointed at the true root cause: the `.bid-table th` "Bid Amount" header was wrapping to two lines ("Bid"/"Amount") in a narrow column, silently taking more vertical space than assumed and eating into the 20-row budget — not that `0.40in` rows were inherently too tall.
3. Fixed properly with `white-space: nowrap` on `.bid-table th`, then **reverted** `BID_SHEET_ROW_HEIGHT_IN` back to `0.40` and `.sheet` padding back to `0.12in 0.25in` — the shrink was a workaround for a bug that's now actually fixed, and page 1 now fills properly again at the original page-filling size.
4. That revert then broke the continuation page (still using `continuationRowCount = 26`, sized for the smaller `0.28in` rows) — a screenshot showed it overflowing onto page 2's front. Reduced to `23`, confirmed via the user's next screenshot check.

**Takeaway for future sessions:** row height and continuation-row-count are coupled constants in the same function with no automatic relationship between them — changing one without recalculating the other will overflow a page. Also: always ask/verify the user's print-dialog **Scale** and **Margins** settings match between destinations (PDF vs. physical printer) before diagnosing a layout bug as a CSS issue — a wrong Scale setting on the user's end can look identical to a real overflow bug in a screenshot.

### 3. Deploy tooling — `deploy.ps1` switched from `curl.exe` to `.NET FtpWebRequest`
**Discovered mid-checkpoint:** `deploy.ps1`'s curl-based upload started failing on *every* attempt (not intermittently) — `curl: (56) response reading failed`. Investigated with `curl -v`: the file transferred **100% of its bytes** every time, but curl couldn't read the server's final "226 Transfer complete" response over the control channel (`schannel: server close notification received` right after the data upload finished) and reported exit 56 regardless. Confirmed via `Last-Modified` header checks that **repeated identical-looking "failures" had genuinely not updated the live file** — a real correctness risk, since `deploy.ps1` was reporting "FAILED" honestly, but a less careful read of that output (or a differently-behaved retry) could easily be mistaken for "probably fine, curl is just flaky."

**Root cause:** `curl.exe` on this machine uses the Windows Schannel TLS backend, which has a bug/incompatibility with this Hostinger FTPS server's connection-closing behavior after a completed transfer.

**Fix:** rewrote `Deploy-File` in `deploy.ps1` to use `System.Net.FtpWebRequest` directly instead of shelling out to curl — reads the local file into memory, opens the FTP request stream, writes the bytes, and checks the server's actual response object rather than an external process's exit code. Added `New-RemoteDir` to recreate curl's old `--ftp-create-dirs` auto-directory-creation (walks each path segment, calling `MakeDirectory`, ignoring "already exists" errors). Added a 300ms `Start-Sleep` between files in full-deploy mode after hitting a real (but different, and transient) `450 File unavailable (file busy)` error under rapid back-to-back connections — confirmed that error resolves on individual retry, unlike the curl issue which did not. Verified end-to-end: single-file deploys, a full all-files deploy (including nested `backend/routes/*.js` — exercises `New-RemoteDir`), and `Images/ETCC-Logo.ico`/`js/toolbar.js` specifically (the two files that hit the transient busy error). Every "OK" now cross-checked against a fresh `Last-Modified` header to confirm it's not a repeat of the curl false-positive/false-negative problem. Committed separately from the checkpoints (`3f2bbee`, "Switch deploy.ps1 from curl to .NET FtpWebRequest") since the user asked for it as a standalone "commit deploy.ps1", not as part of a checkpoint.

### 4. `test.html` updated, confirmed green (both checkpoints)
**v6.7:** new suites `'Bid Sheet — duplex 4-page layout (v6.7)'` (8 assertions covering the 4-page structure, continuation page content, and the continuous bid ladder) and `'Bid Sheet — page 1 row height fits all 20 rows (v6.7)'` (3 assertions, later annotated as superseded once v6.8 reverted the values). The pre-existing `'Bid Sheet — exactly two pages per item'` suite was renamed to `'Bid Sheet — description & label-page layout'` and its page-count-specific assertions removed, since the app no longer emits exactly two pages per item.

**v6.8:** new suite `'Bid Sheet — row height reverted to page-filling value (v6.8)'` (3 assertions covering the `0.40in`/`0.12in`/`continuationRowCount=23` revert), plus the v6.7 row-height suite and the duplex-layout suite's stale `26`/`0.28in`/`46`-specific assertion text updated to reflect the final v6.8 numbers and point at v6.8 for the current state.

### 5. Checkpoints v6.7 and v6.8 (minor version bumps)
Two straightforward minor bumps (`.\bump-version.ps1`, no `-Major` requested) — v6.7 after the duplex-layout feature landed and was confirmed working via screenshot, v6.8 after the row-height revert/continuation-count fix was confirmed via a follow-up screenshot.

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.6)

Two-part follow-up in the same day as v6.5 below — a new interaction pattern requested by the user (double-click to edit), then a cleanup request that removed the UI it replaced.

### 1. New feature — double-click a Donated Items row opens an Edit Item modal
**First request:** "double clicking a row should open editing" — implemented initially as attaching a double-click handler that called the existing in-row `editItemByNumber()` (same as the Edit button, just triggered by a dblclick instead of a click).

**Follow-up request, same turn:** "open editing form in a modular page with save and cancel" — this meant a proper modal, not in-row inline editing. Built `#item-edit-modal` (`index.html`, inserted at the end of the Step 1 `screen-item-load` section, right before its closing `</section>`) modeled directly on the existing `#bidder-edit-modal` pattern:
- Fields: Item #, Category (`<select>` built from the global `CATEGORIES` map), Submission Date, Description (`<textarea>`), Item Value, Reserve Amount, Donor Name (`<textarea>`), Donor Email (`<textarea>`), Donor Phone.
- `openItemEditModal(itemNumber)` populates every field and stores the original item number on `modal.dataset.originalItemNumber` (so a rename mid-edit doesn't break the save lookup).
- `saveItemEditModal()` writes all fields back, sets `source = 'Edited'`, and — **a real improvement over the old in-row editor, which never had this** — if the Item # was changed and a winner record exists under the old number, it's copied to the new key and the old key deleted, so renaming an item no longer silently orphans a recorded win.
- `closeItemEditModal()` is a plain hide, no side effects (Cancel behavior).
- The double-click listener (attached per-row in `refreshItemsTable()`) skips read-only mode, and bails via `e.target.closest('input, button, select, textarea, a')` so clicking the row's checkbox or (at the time) the Edit/View buttons didn't also fire the modal.

**Follow-up sizing request:** a screenshot of the modal in use showed the Description box looking cramped relative to real donation descriptions — bumped `#edit-item-description` from `rows="3"` to `rows="8"` to match.

### 2. Removed — the Actions column (View/Edit buttons) from Donated Items
Once double-click became the primary edit path, the user asked to remove the Actions column and its buttons entirely. Removed:
- `<th>Actions</th>`, its `<col style="width:200px;">`, and the row template's trailing `<td>` (View + Edit buttons) from `#items-table`.
- Table `min-width` recalculated 1986px → 1786px (verified against the sum of the 11 remaining column widths); empty-state colspan 12 → 11.
- `emailIdx`/`EMAIL_ICON`, which existed solely to feed the removed View button — deleted outright as genuinely dead loop-local code, not flagged (there's nothing standalone worth preserving there, unlike a whole function).

**Orphaned, not deleted** (per the project's standing convention): `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`, `rowCheckboxOffset()`, `editItemByNumber()`, `saveItemEdit()`, `cancelItemEdit()` — the whole in-row-edit cluster lost its only caller. Left in place with an explicit `ORPHANED` comment block above `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN` naming the cluster, explaining why, pointing at the replacement, and flagging that `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`'s `actions:10` index is now stale (the column it pointed at no longer exists) in case this code is ever revived without updating it first.

**Checked, needed no change:** `showEmailModal()` itself is still called from the separate Email inbox table's own View button — only the Donated Items call site was removed. The View All modal clones `#items-table`'s thead/tbody dynamically with no hardcoded column-count assumption, so it picked up the Actions-column removal automatically.

### 3. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
Three new suites: the modal itself (8 assertions — population, field types, save/rename-carries-winner/empty-Item#-rejected, cancel), the Actions-column removal (5 assertions), and the orphaned-code flagging (3 assertions).

### 4. Checkpoint v6.6 (minor version bump)
Straightforward minor bump from v6.5 via `.\bump-version.ps1` (no `-Major` requested).

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.5)

Small, single-topic follow-up in the same day as v6.1→v6.4 below — the user pointed out a real overflow issue on a report screen not touched earlier in this session.

### 1. Real bug — Items Not Won report's Item # and Donor Phone columns wrapped onto two lines
**Symptom (from a screenshot):** on the standalone "Items Not Won" print report (`printItemsNotWonReport()` in `index.html`, ~line 8750), the "Item #" header wrapped to "Item" / "#" and "Donor Phone" wrapped to "Donor" / "Phone" — the narrow columns didn't have room for the two-word labels on one line, and phone number values in the data rows could wrap too.

**Fix:** added `style="white-space:nowrap;"` to both the `<th>` header cells and the corresponding `<td>` data cells for Item # and Donor Phone. Left Description, Category, Donor Name, and Donor Email untouched — those are meant to wrap.

### 2. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
New suite `'Items Not Won report — Item # / Donor Phone no longer wrap (v6.5)'` (3 assertions covering the header fix, the data-cell fix, and that unrelated columns were left alone). Deployed via `.\deploy.ps1 test.html`, confirmed green by the user before the checkpoint.

### 3. Checkpoint v6.5 (minor version bump)
Straightforward minor bump from v6.4 via `.\bump-version.ps1` (no `-Major` requested).

### Files touched this session

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.4)

Small follow-up found by the user reviewing live screens right after the v6.3 checkpoint — the same donor-name overflow bug fixed on the Donated Items table earlier in this session had a twin on a different table, and a page-height inconsistency on Registrations.

### 1. Real bug — Donor Name/Email overflow recurred on the Create Bid Sheets table
**Symptom:** the same visual overflow already fixed earlier this session on `#items-table` (Donated Items) reappeared on `#bs-items-table` (Create Bid Sheets) for the same item (900-1, "Wilderness Trail Distillery, Attn. Grayson Yaden").

**Root cause:** the two tables have **entirely separate row-rendering functions** (`refreshItemsTable()` vs. `refreshBsItemsTable()`) — fixing one's Donor Name/Email `<td>` styling doesn't touch the other's.

**Fix:** added the same `white-space:normal;word-break:break-word;vertical-align:top` to `refreshBsItemsTable()`'s donorName/donorEmail cells (`index.html:6053-6054`). Also checked `printDonatedItemsList()` (the standalone "🖨 Print" page) — it uses default (non-`table-layout:fixed`) table layout, so it isn't exposed to this bug class at all and needed no change.

### 2. Real bug — Registrations table subtracting ~110px more than sibling screens
**Symptom:** the Registrations table (32 bidders) showed noticeably fewer rows before scrolling than comparable screens, with unexplained empty space below the card.

**Root cause:** `#bidders-card`'s scroll container used `max-height:calc(100vh - 388px)`, while every structurally similar screen (Winning Bidders, Create Bid Sheets, Payments) uses `calc(100vh - 278px)` — despite those screens having comparable extra content above their tables (e.g. Winning Bidders' save-note bar vs. Registrations' metric-row). No comment explained the 388px figure; it was a silent outlier.

**Fix:** matched the established `278px` convention rather than guessing a new number (`index.html:1255`).

### 3. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
New suite `'Create Bid Sheets table — Donor Name/Email wrap fix (v6.4)'` (2 assertions) and `'Registrations table — scroll height matched to sibling screens (v6.4)'` (2 assertions).

### Files touched this session

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.3)

The largest single checkpoint of this multi-day arc — the bid sheet algorithm was restated from scratch by the user, went through a mid-session revision that turned out wrong, got corrected by a real bug report, and the printed sheet's layout was overhauled to a fully fixed-height design. Three test suites had gone stale or actively wrong by the end and were rewritten, not just added to.

### 1. Bid sheet algorithm restated as OPEN vs. PREMIUM auctions
The user restated the entire algorithm explicitly (quoted here since it's the rule now in force):

> First a bid sheet is either for an **open auction** (Value ≤ $35.00) or a **premium auction** (Value > $35.00). Open auction: only the first bid is preprinted — $1 with no reserve, or the reserve when present. Premium auction: all bids preprinted — first bid is the reserve when present or 30% of value when no reserve; increment is 10% of value if value < $100, 7% if value ≥ $100.

Implemented in `printBiddingSheets()` (`index.html`) with `isOpenBid`/`startingBid`/`incPct` variables named to match this terminology directly, replacing several sessions' worth of accumulated ad-hoc comments. **Caught and fixed a real boundary bug while rewriting**: the old code used `Value > $100 → 7%`; the user's restatement is `Value ≥ $100 → 7%`. An item valued at exactly $100 was getting the wrong bracket before this fix.

### 2. Mid-session revision, then a reversal (important — read if touching this code)
Before landing on the above, this session went through **two prior revisions of "what counts as OPEN"** within the same conversation:
1. **v6.0** (previous checkpoint): OPEN required *no reserve at all* — any reserve excluded an item outright, regardless of value.
2. **A revision partway through this session**: a reserve counted toward the OPEN check too — an item was OPEN if `(reserve if set, else value) <= threshold`. This shipped as part of the v6.2 checkpoint.
3. **This session's correction**: a live bug report — item 800-1, Value $50 (above the $35 threshold) but Reserve $25 (below it) — printed a **blank** OPEN-style sheet under rule #2, when the user expected a normal, fully preprinted sheet since the item's actual value was well above the threshold. The user confirmed explicitly: **Value alone decides OPEN vs. PREMIUM membership**; reserve only ever affects the *first bid amount*, never membership. Rule #2 was reverted.

`test.html` now carries a suite specifically titled to document this reversal (`'Bid Sheets — reserve does NOT decide OPEN/PREMIUM membership (v6.2, corrected)'`) so a future session reading old commits or a stale summary doesn't resurrect rule #2.

### 3. `starting-bid-list.php` updated to match, each time
Both the reserve-counts revision and its reversal were mirrored into `starting-bid-list.php` in the same sessions they happened in JS, keeping the two files in sync throughout (per the standing convention documented in open item #6 above).

### 4. Bid sheet layout — fixed-height Description and Category/Donor/Value/Reserve boxes
Requested from a screenshot of a real printed sheet showing a 4-line Description box and a 2-line Category/Donor/Value row — the user wanted every sheet to use that same fixed layout regardless of content length.

- **Description box**: `height:0.92in` (computed from the box's 16.8px font / 1.2 line-height + padding/border), `overflow:hidden`, `box-sizing:border-box`. Hard `height`, not `min-height` — the user explicitly asked for fixed values, not a content-driven minimum.
- **Category/Donor/Value/Reserve row**: `height:0.50in` on the CSS grid container, plus explicit `line-height:1.2` on each cell (not previously set).
- **Real bug found and fixed mid-implementation**: setting `height:0.50in` on the grid container alone wasn't enough — its implicit `auto`-sized row track still grew to fit the tallest cell's natural content, and a 3-line donor address ("Wilderness Trail Distillery, Attn. Grayson Yaden") bled into the bid table's header row below it, even though each cell already had its own `overflow:hidden`. Fixed by adding `grid-auto-rows:0.50in` **and** `overflow:hidden` **on the container itself** — a child's own overflow:hidden doesn't stop its grid container from growing.
- Simplified `page-break-inside` to always `'avoid'` (previously switched to `'auto'` past 400 description characters to avoid a Chrome print-layout hang) — now that every box is fixed-height, the sheet's total height can never grow, so that risk no longer exists.
- **Row height raised 0.28in → 0.40in** ("to better fill the page" — this became the v6.4-adjacent `BID_SHEET_ROW_HEIGHT_IN` constant, see below).

### 5. Removed: per-item Row Height column + toolbar control (Create Bid Sheets table)
Per explicit user request ("remove row height from each row and header", then "eliminate the toolbar's single global Row Height (in) control" as a follow-up in the same turn):
- Removed `<th>Row Height</th>`, its `<col>`, the per-row `<input class="bs-row-height">`, and `updateItemRowHeight()` (no remaining callers).
- Removed the entire toolbar `rowHeightWrap`/`rowHeightInput` construction and its change handler, including the per-item cascade-cleanup logic that only existed to service the now-gone override.
- Replaced with a single fixed JS constant, `BID_SHEET_ROW_HEIGHT_IN` (0.28, later changed to 0.40 per item 4 above), read nowhere from Settings.
- `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.bidRowHeight` left in place, flagged as orphaned in a comment (existing stored settings/items may still carry the old value) — nothing reads or writes it anymore.

### 6. Removed: Date Loaded column (Create Bid Sheets table)
Straightforward column removal (header, `<col>`, row cell, empty-state colspan). The underlying `item.loaded_date` data field is untouched — still set on item creation elsewhere, just no longer displayed in this table.

### 7. `test.html` — three suites rewritten (not just added to), because they had gone stale or actively wrong
- `'Bid Sheet — Bid Amount Algorithm'` (v3.1) — was still asserting the pre-Open-Bids formula (increment based on reserve-substituted value, not Item Value). Updated the local `computeBidAmounts()` mirror and its expected numbers (one assertion's expected diff changed from 8 to 7).
- `'Bid Sheet — Row Height (Global + Per-Item)'` (v3.1) — described a feature that no longer exists. Rewritten to explicitly document the removal rather than deleted outright, so a future session sees "this was removed" instead of just finding no test at all.
- The three "Open Bids" suites from v6.0/v6.2 — one still used the old `reserveRaw === 0` check, one **actively asserted the now-reversed rule** ("a reserve counts toward Open Bids"), and the Starting Bid List suite quoted stale PHP. All rewritten; the reversed one was kept as its own dedicated suite specifically to document the reversal (see item 2 above).
- Every executable numeric assertion (`bidLadder()`, `computeBidAmounts()`) was independently re-verified against the real formulas in a standalone Node script before deploying, not just eyeballed — this caught the false "Open Bids = 0 disables the category entirely" claim from the v6.0 session (a $0/undeclared item still qualifies at exactly 0) during a prior pass, and this session's rewrite followed the same discipline.

### 8. Checkpoint v6.3 — version bump correction
`/ETCCSAMCheckpoint` (no version argument) was run and a **major** bump to v7.0 was applied by mistake — the standing procedure is minor-by-default, major only if the user explicitly asks, and no such request was made this time. Caught before committing; reverted to **v6.3** (correct minor bump from v6.2) via a direct edit to the footer span, then re-deployed and committed normally. No v7.0 was ever pushed or is live anywhere.

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.2)

Continuation of the same-day v6.1 session. Two new bid-sheet features plus one iOS bug fix — note that this checkpoint's "reserve counts toward Open Bids" change was **reversed in the very next checkpoint (v6.3)** after a real bug report; see that write-up above for the full story. Read this section for historical context only, not as the current rule.

### 1. Favicon — apple-touch-icon added for iOS
**Symptom reported:** the favicon didn't appear on iPhone/iPad. **Root cause:** iOS Safari ignores `<link rel="icon">` entirely — it only reads `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`, which this app never had. **Fix:** added the tag to `<head>`, wired `updateFavicon()` to keep it in lockstep with the regular favicon (same Club Favicon URL setting, no new field). **Known limitation, explicitly flagged in a test assertion:** the current default image (`Images/ETCClogoWhiteBackground.png`) is 150×116px and non-square, below Apple's 180×180 square guidance — no image-editing tooling was available in this environment to produce a proper one, so iOS may crop/pad it imperfectly. Shows something now rather than nothing, but isn't crisp.

### 2. "Open Bids" — new bid-sheet category (first version, later revised)
New Settings → Auction Setup → "Open Bids" threshold (default $35): items at or below it get a $1 (or reserve, if the reserve itself was also ≤ threshold under this version's rule) opening bid with no preprinted increments. **This session's rule for what counted as "open"** — a reserve counted toward the check, not just an unreserved low-value item — **was reversed in v6.3**; see that write-up for why. The Settings UI, `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.openBidMax`, and the general shape of the feature (fixed row 1, blank rows 2-20) all survived into the current version unchanged; only the membership rule changed.

### 3. Bid ladder — every preprinted row forced strictly higher than the last
Real bug: rounding a sub-$1 increment could collapse consecutive rows onto the same dollar figure (e.g. a $2 reserve stepping by $0.20 printed `2, 2, 2, 3, 3...`). Fixed with a per-row guard (`if (prevAmt !== null && amt <= prevAmt) amt = prevAmt + 1`) rather than rounding the increment up globally, specifically so already-correct ladders keep their exact amounts. This guard is unchanged in the current (v6.3) version of the algorithm.

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.1)

Small, single-topic follow-up in the same day as the v6.0 session below — the user asked "where is the favicon," which surfaced a real duplicate-fallback bug while answering.

### 1. Real bug — two disagreeing hardcoded favicon fallbacks
**How it surfaced:** answering "where is the favicon" required tracing all the code paths that touch it, which turned up an inconsistency: the `<head>` `<link rel="icon">` tag and `getClub().favicon` ([index.html:6348](index.html:6348)) both defaulted to `Images/ETCClogoWhiteBackground.png`, but `updateFavicon()` ([index.html:6263](index.html:6263), pre-fix) carried its own separate hardcoded fallback, `Images/ETCC-Logo.ico`. With no `clubFavicon` setting configured, the tab icon's actual value depended on which code path ran last — the `.png` on first paint from the static tag, then potentially the `.ico` once settings loaded and `applyBranding()`/`updateFavicon()` ran.

**Fix:** `updateFavicon()` no longer carries its own literal — it now reads `link.href = faviconUrl || getClub().favicon`, deferring to `getClub()` as the single source of truth. Also removed the `type="image/png"` attribute from the static `<head>` tag, since Settings → Club Branding → Club Favicon URL can point the href at any format (`.ico`/`.svg`/etc.) and a hardcoded png type would misdescribe those overrides.

**Where the favicon can be changed:** Settings → Club Branding → **Club Favicon URL** (`#inp-club-favicon` → `clubFavicon` setting, applied via `applyBranding()`/`updateFavicon()`).

### 2. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
New suite `'Favicon — unified default fallback (v6.1)'` (4 assertions) covering the root cause, the fix, the `<head>` tag's type-attribute removal, and that `getClub()` remains the sole place the default path is defined. Deployed via `.\deploy.ps1 test.html`, confirmed green by the user before the checkpoint.

### 3. Checkpoint v6.1 (minor version bump)
Straightforward minor bump from v6.0 via `.\bump-version.ps1` (no `-Major` requested).

### Files touched this session

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v6.0)

Four independent threads, all driven by the user reviewing the live app and reporting what they saw. Two were new bid-sheet requirements; two were real UI bugs. Everything landed in one v6.0 checkpoint.

### 1. Real bug — Home Auctions panel empty until a hard refresh
**Symptom reported:** logging in at https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/ showed a splash screen with no data ("No auctions yet"), and only `Ctrl+Shift+R` followed by re-entering the password produced the real screen. The user noted their other apps don't behave this way. The console screenshot showed several `401` responses from `api.php` plus `get_all: Unauthorized`.

**Root cause (a render-ordering bug, not an auth bug):** the top-level `init()` IIFE in `index.html` calls `updateHomeAuctionPanel()` / `renderAuctionsList()` unconditionally at page load. At that moment the user is not yet logged in, and `get_all` is deliberately **not** in `api.php`'s `$publicActions` list, so it correctly returns 401 and the panel renders against empty data. On a successful password entry, `initializePasswordScreen()`'s `checkPassword()` *did* re-sync the real data via `syncFromKeyValueDB()` — but then only called `refreshHomeMetrics()`, which repaints the four small stat tiles and **nothing else**. The auctions panel/list was never re-rendered, so it stayed stuck on its pre-login empty render. A hard refresh "fixed" it only because by then the PHP session cookie was already valid, letting the *pre-login* boot fetch succeed on that second load. The 401s in the console were therefore expected/by-design, not the fault.

**Fix:** both login success paths now call `updateHomeAuctionPanel()` and `renderAuctionsList()` immediately after the post-login `syncFromKeyValueDB()` / `refreshHomeMetrics()` — `checkPassword()` (normal password screen) and the maintenance-screen `submit()` handler. Display layer only; no auth/session logic touched. Both functions are pure re-renders already called elsewhere (`archiveAuction()`, `openAuction()`), so calling them again is idempotent.

### 2. New feature — "Open Bids" category on bid sheets
**Request:** support two types of bid sheet based on the item's value *when no reserve is specified*. New setting **"Open Bids"** = the maximum declared value that counts as open-bid, default **$35.00**. Open-bid items get a $1 starting bid and no bid increments; every other item's sheet is unchanged.

**Design decision made by the user** (asked explicitly, since it changes a physical printout): of three options for the Bid Amount column, the user chose **"first row shows $1, rows 2-20 blank."** Not a blank column with a "Starting Bid: $1" header box, and not all 20 rows reading $1. Nothing else on the sheet changed — no extra info box was added.

**Implementation, all in `index.html`:**
- `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` gains `openBidMax: 35`, grouped with the other bid-sheet defaults.
- Settings → **Auction Setup** card gains `#inp-open-bid-max`, directly below Bid Count.
- Settings load reads `s.openBidMax ?? 35`; the save builder writes `openBidMax: parseFloat(...) || 0`. The `??` (not `||`) matters — it preserves an explicit `0`.
- `printBiddingSheets()`: `const isOpenBid = reserveRaw === 0 && itemValueRaw <= openBidMax;` → `startingBid = 1`, `incrementAmount = 0`, and the row renderer emits an empty `<td>` for `idx > 0`.

**Semantics worth knowing:**
- An item **with** a reserve is never open-bid, no matter how low its value.
- The threshold is **inclusive** ($35 exactly still qualifies at the default).
- **Setting Open Bids to 0 disables the category** for anything with a declared value. Blank/invalid input also saves as 0, matching how `squarePct`/`squareFee` already behave.
- An item with **neither value nor reserve** falls into the open-bid category. This is a strict improvement — previously such an item produced a sheet with 20 rows all reading `$0`.

### 3. `starting-bid-list.php` aligned with the new bid math
The standalone Starting Bid List computes its own starting bid in PHP and would have kept showing 30%-of-value for open-bid items, contradicting the printed sheet. On the user's go-ahead it now applies the identical rule:
```php
$isOpenBid = $reserve <= 0 && $value <= $openBidMax;
$startingBid = $isOpenBid ? 1 : ($reserve > 0 ? $reserve : ($value * $startingBidPct / 100));
```
- `$openBidMax` is read from `sam_settings` using `isset(...) && ... !== ''` — the strict `!==` lets an integer `0` through as "disabled", matching the JS `??` behavior, while a missing/blank value falls back to 35.
- Parsed via `(float)preg_replace('/[^0-9.]/', '', ...)`, mirroring the JS `parseMoney()` helper, so a setting stored as `"$35.00"` resolves to 35 rather than 0.
- **The nested ternary is deliberately parenthesized** — PHP 8 fatals on unparenthesized nested ternaries, and this file could not be linted locally (no `php` on PATH; see open item #7).
- A header comment now names `printBiddingSheets()` as the function this must stay in sync with. See open item #6 — this is now a two-implementation rule.

### 4. Real bug — preprinted bid rows could repeat the same amount
**Request:** "make sure every preprinted bid row is larger than the previous row."

**Root cause:** amounts were built as `Math.round(startingBid + i * incrementAmount)`. When the increment rounded to under $1, consecutive rows collapsed onto the same dollar figure — e.g. a **$2 reserve** steps by 10% = $0.20 and printed `2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3…`. Only reachable for low-value reserved items (unreserved low-value items are now open-bid and print blank rows anyway).

**Fix:** a per-row guard — `if (prevAmt !== null && amt <= prevAmt) amt = prevAmt + 1;`. Chosen deliberately **over** rounding the increment up globally (`Math.max(1, Math.round(inc))`), because the guard leaves already-correct ladders byte-identical. Verified: `$40 → 12,16,20,24,28`, `$150 → 45,56,66,77,87,98` (keeps its uneven 11/10 spacing from the 7% rate), `$500 reserve → 500,535,570,605` — all unchanged. Only genuinely broken ladders shift (`$2 reserve → 2,3,4,5,6,7`).

### 5. Real bug — Developer nav row closed the drawer out from under its own submenu
**Request:** "when the developer password is validated, show the menu bar on the left."

**Root cause:** the off-canvas nav IIFE attached `closeNav` to **every** `.nav-item` — including `#nav-developer`. But that row doesn't navigate anywhere; `toggleDeveloperMenu()` expands `#nav-developer-submenu` *in place*. So clicking it removed `body.nav-open` and slid the drawer off-screen, while `submitAuthPassword()` dutifully expanded the submenu inside the now-hidden drawer. The menu was working the whole time — it was just off-screen.

**Fix:** exempt `#nav-developer` from that handler (`if (el.id === 'nav-developer') return;`). No ancestor of that element matches the `.nav-item, a` selector, so skipping the element itself fully suppresses the close. Submenu entries (Configuration / Settings / Change Log / API / Import Members) still close the drawer, since those *are* real navigation targets.

**Two deliberate scoping choices:** (a) this also fixes the **already-authenticated** path — within the 30-minute settings-auth window the drawer used to close with no password prompt to blame; (b) the fix lives in the nav click handler rather than forcing the drawer open inside `submitAuthPassword()`, because that function *also* gates deleting an auction and deep-links to developer screens, where popping the drawer open would cover the screen the user just asked for. Verified safe: `#auth-modal` is z-index 2000 vs `#nav` at 200 and `#nav-backdrop` at 150, so the modal renders cleanly above an open drawer.

### 6. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
Four new suites (24 assertions), plus the login-fix suite relabeled from v5.4 to v6.0 (a v5.4 checkpoint landed from a different session mid-stream, so the original label would have been wrong).

The bid-sheet suite is **genuinely executable**, not documentation-style: it carries a local `bidLadder()` mirror of `printBiddingSheets()`'s arithmetic (copied rather than imported, since the real function builds an entire print document via `openPrintWindow()`) and asserts against real computed output — open-bid detection, the $1 opening bid, strict monotonicity across 16 value/reserve combinations, the sub-$1 collapse fix, and a no-regression check pinning the $40/$150/$500 ladders to their exact prior amounts.

**That paid off immediately:** it caught a false assertion in the tests themselves. The claim "Open Bids = 0 disables the category entirely" is wrong — a $0/undeclared item still qualifies at 0, because `0 <= 0` holds. The assertion was corrected to "…for every item with a declared value" rather than the behavior being changed, since a $0 item landing in the open-bid category is the desirable outcome (it's what avoids the old all-`$0` sheet).

### 7. Checkpoint v6.0 (major bump, user-requested)
Invoked as `/ETCCSAMCheckpoint v6.0`. Current version was **v5.4** (not v5.3 — a "Donated Items table zoom" checkpoint had landed from a separate session in between), so `.\bump-version.ps1 -Major` reached exactly v6.0. All `deploy.ps1` calls succeeded first try this session, including the `.php` file.

## What was accomplished in the v5.2 / v5.3 sessions (Donated Items table layout)

These two checkpoints never got their own write-up (the `/ETCCSAMEnd` run that would have covered them didn't happen before the v5.4 session took over the doc). Recorded briefly here so the version history has no gap — all of it is layout-only work on the Step 1 Donated Items table (`#items-table` in `index.html`):

- **v5.2** — rebalanced column widths after long donor addresses from `add-item.php` made the table read badly: Description widened 360px → 660px, and Value / Reserve / Donor Name / Donor Email narrowed (90→70, 90→70, 260→180, 260→200). Table `min-width` tracked the changes.
- **v5.3** — increased the table's scroll container from `max-height:258px` to `600px` so roughly 15+ rows are visible before scrolling starts. Same checkpoint also carried a pending `starting-bid-list.php` fix that had been sitting uncommitted: `white-space:nowrap` on Category/Donor Name was letting long content push past their intended share and squeeze Description, so that table moved to a fixed `<colgroup>` (Item # 7%, Category 24%, Starting Bid 8%, Donor Name 14%, Description 47%) with wrapping, and the card widened 700px → 900px.

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v5.4)

Two threads: diagnosing a set of Home-screen metric questions the user raised (no code bugs found, one piece of user education plus confirming an existing tool covered the need), then a small new feature (table zoom).

### 1. Home-screen metrics investigation — no bugs found
The user asked three follow-up questions about the Home screen's metric tiles (`refreshHomeMetrics()` in `index.html`):

- **"Bidders: 17" vs. Registrations screen showing 25.** Traced both to the same source — `Bidders.getAll()` → `DB.getBidders()` → `localStorage['sam_{auctionId}_bidders']` — so they should never disagree. Likely explanations given to the user: the Home tile only recalculates when `navigate('home')` fires `refreshHomeMetrics()`, so it can go stale if you register more bidders without revisiting Home; or transient drift from the dual-layer localStorage+MySQL sync (see `[[project_data_sync_architecture]]`). User was advised to hard-refresh and compare again; no follow-up report came back in this session, so **this discrepancy is not confirmed resolved** — if it resurfaces, start from this explanation rather than re-diagnosing from scratch.
- **"Paid & Picked Up: 5" despite "Winners Recorded: 0" and the Pay & Pickup screen itself saying "No winners recorded yet."** Root cause identified: the tile counts raw entries in `sam_payments` (`Object.values(payments).filter(p => p.paid).length`) regardless of whether a winner currently exists for that bidder — so these were **orphaned payment records** left over from before winners got cleared/reset for this auction. No live "winners → clear their payments too" cascade exists.
- **User asked to add a "Clear Payments" Developer Tools action.** Checked `index.html`'s Developer Tools card first — a `btn-clear-payments` button labeled **"Clear Pickup & Pay"** already exists (line ~1859), wired to `clearScopedData('payments', 'pickup & pay records')` and respecting the "Clear scope" auction dropdown above it. **No code was added** — the user was pointed at the existing button/flow instead (Developer Tools → set Clear scope to the current auction → Clear Pickup & Pay).

No files changed for this thread.

### 2. New feature — Donated Items table zoom in/out
The user asked for the ability to zoom in/out on the Donated Items table (Step 1 screen, `#items-table`). No existing zoom mechanism existed anywhere in the app (confirmed via grep for "zoom").

Implementation in `index.html`:
- Added a zoom control group (− / percentage label / + / Reset) to `#items-card`'s card-header toolbar, right of the 🖨 Print button.
- Wrapped the table's scroll container with `id="items-table-wrap"` (previously an unlabeled `<div style="overflow:auto;max-height:600px;">`) as the zoom target.
- New functions: `applyItemsZoom(pct)` sets `#items-table-wrap.style.zoom = pct/100` and updates the `#items-zoom-label` text; `zoomItemsTable(delta)` reads/writes the current percentage from `localStorage['sam_items_zoom']` (default 100), steps by 10 per click, clamps to **60%–150%**, and `delta === 0` (the Reset button) forces exactly 100%.
- Zoom **persists across reloads**: the app-init block (same block that calls `TableKit.initAll()` / `fixAllStickyHeaders()` / `applyBranding()`) now also calls `applyItemsZoom(parseInt(localStorage.getItem('sam_items_zoom'), 10) || 100)` on load.
- Deliberately used the CSS `zoom` property directly on the wrapper `<div>`, not a TableKit option — `table.css`/`table.js` are untouched, per the project's "never modify TableKit files" rule. `zoom` is Chromium/Edge-native; this is an internal admin tool so that's an acceptable tradeoff, but it won't work in Firefox if that's ever a real requirement — worth flagging if a user reports the buttons doing nothing.

### 3. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
Added a new suite `'Donated Items table — zoom in/out controls (this session)'` (4 assertions covering the toolbar controls, the clamped step/reset logic, the CSS-zoom-not-TableKit approach, and reload persistence). Deployed via `.\deploy.ps1 test.html`, then **confirmed green by the user** at https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/test.html before the checkpoint.

### 4. Checkpoint v5.4 (minor version bump)
Straightforward minor bump via `.\bump-version.ps1` (no `-Major` requested).

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v5.1)

Short session, two independent threads of work against `starting-bid-list.php` and a new (ultimately removed) form.

### 1. `starting-bid-list.php` — Member Name column replaced with Donor Name
A quick follow-up correction: the Starting Bid List's "Member Name" column (sourced from `etcc_member_name`, the ETCC member who submitted the item) was replaced with a **Donor Name** column (`donor_name`, the actual item donor) — the list is meant to credit donors, not track which club member did the data entry. Column order is now **Item # / Category / Starting Bid / Donor Name / Description**, same `white-space:nowrap` treatment as before, just on the renamed/re-sourced column. `test.html`'s `starting-bid-list.php` suite (originally written "v4.8 session," predating the actual v5.0 ship) had two assertions referencing "Member Name" — both corrected to describe the current Donor Name column, with a note that this was a deliberate correction, not a bug.

### 2. Built, then fully reverted — `silent-auction-form.php`, a public item-donation form with no member picker
The user asked for "a public silent auction form very similar to the item donation form." After a clarifying `AskUserQuestion` (they picked **"Duplicate/rename of `add-item.php`"**), this was first built as an exact file copy of `add-item.php` → `silent-auction-form.php`, deployed and working identically.

The user then asked to change its title to "Public Item Donation" and remove the ETCC Member Name/Email fields. A second `AskUserQuestion` (should this apply to `add-item.php` too, or just the new file?) confirmed **only `silent-auction-form.php`** — `add-item.php` stays as the internal, member-picker version; the new file was meant to be the fully public one. The following changes were made to `silent-auction-form.php` only:
- Subtitle changed to "Public Item Donation" (title tag and on-page `<div class="sub">`).
- Removed the `$members` SQL lookup/sort block entirely (no longer needed).
- Removed `etccMemberName`/`memberEmail` from `$values`, the POST-field read loop, the "required" validation, the `$newItem` write (`etcc_member_name` key dropped from the item record), the confirmation-email row list, and the email-To override logic (previously the selected member's email took priority as the confirmation recipient — with the field gone, `emailTo` now always uses the Settings-configured `donationEmailTo` address).
- Removed the ETCC Member Name `<select>`, its "— choose —" member-list `<option>`s, the read-only Member Email `<input>`, and the `samFillMemberEmail()` JS that synced them.
- Updated the file's top comment block to describe it as a public-audience duplicate of `add-item.php` with the member fields stripped out, rather than reusing `add-item.php`'s original comment verbatim.

**Then immediately reverted**: the user said "remove the new form." Verified via grep that nothing else in the codebase referenced `silent-auction-form.php` (it was never wired into `index.html` or any other page — always a standalone bookmarkable URL, same as `add-item.php`), then:
- Deleted it from the live server directly via an FTP `DELE` command (same approach used historically to remove `donate-item.php` — `deploy.ps1` has no built-in remote-delete helper, so this was a manual `curl ... -Q "DELE silent-auction-form.php"` against `ftp.etccapps.com`), confirmed with a follow-up `curl` HEAD-equivalent request that `https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/silent-auction-form.php` now 404s.
- Deleted the local file.
- Since the file was created and removed within the same session **before ever being committed**, `git status` shows no trace of it — nothing to revert or clean up in git history.

**Net effect on `add-item.php` and `test.html`**: none — `add-item.php` was never touched, and `silent-auction-form.php` never had regression-suite coverage added (it existed only briefly, mid-session), so no test assertions needed removing either.

### 3. `test.html` updated, confirmed green
Only the two stale "Member Name" assertions in the `starting-bid-list.php` suite needed correcting (see #1 above) — no new suite was needed since the `silent-auction-form.php` detour left no lasting code to cover. Deployed via `.\deploy.ps1 test.html`, then **confirmed green by the user** at https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/test.html before the v5.1 checkpoint.

### 4. Checkpoint v5.1 (minor version bump)
Straightforward minor bump via `.\bump-version.ps1` (no `-Major` flag requested this time, unlike the prior v5.0 session).

### Files touched this session
| File | Status | Notes |

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v5.0)

Built entirely from a single fresh-start feature request that then went through many small rounds of live, iterative feedback (each a one-line follow-up). Summarized in final end-state order, not literal chat order.

### 1. New feature — `starting-bid-list.php`, a printable Starting Bid List
The user asked for "a page listing items donated" with Print and Done buttons, showing item number, category, description, and a starting bid (reserve, or Starting Bid % × value if no reserve).

**First attempt (superseded within the session):** built as an in-app JS function `printStartingBidList()` on the Donated Items screen (`index.html`), wired to a new "🖨 Starting Bid List" toolbar button — generated the report into a popup window via `document.write()`, the same pattern `printDonatedItemsList()` already uses.

**Final design (what's actually shipped):** the user then asked to remove that button and said they needed a **URL** for the list instead. Since the popup-window approach has no bookmarkable address, this was rebuilt as a real standalone PHP page — `starting-bid-list.php` — following the exact pattern `add-item.php` already established:
- No password gate, no login (same explicit convention as `add-item.php`) — public, reachable directly at **https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/starting-bid-list.php**.
- Reads live data **server-side from the SQL `sam_store` table**, not from localStorage: looks up `sam_current_auction` to pick the right `sam_{auctionId}_items` key (falling back to `sam_items`), decodes that JSON blob, and reads `sam_settings` for `startingBidPct`.
- The in-app popup version (`printStartingBidList()` JS function and its toolbar button) was fully deleted from `index.html` once the standalone page replaced it — no orphaned code left behind, since it was a same-session addition-then-replacement rather than a persisted feature being retired.

### 2. Iterative refinement of `starting-bid-list.php` (all same-session follow-ups)
In the order requested:
- **Column order**: started as Item # / Category / Description / Starting Bid, then Starting Bid was moved to directly after Category (Item # / Category / Starting Bid / Description).
- **Member Name column added**, sourced from `etcc_member_name` (the same field `add-item.php`'s "ETCC Member Name" dropdown writes), inserted between Starting Bid and Description. Final column order: **Item # / Category / Starting Bid / Member Name / Description**.
- **Print sizing**: "make print wider, make form narrower" — interpreted as: constrain the on-screen content to a narrower column (`max-width` on the content) while widening the printed page. First implementation switched print to landscape orientation; a later request ("make form modular" — user clarified via `AskUserQuestion` this meant **"not full page"**) reverted print back to **portrait**, keeping the printed table the same narrower width as the screen view rather than stretching it edge-to-edge.
- **Nowrap columns**: Item #, Category, and Member Name given `white-space:nowrap` so they never wrap onto a second line (Starting Bid and Description still wrap normally).
- **Header text**: changed to `<h2>Silent Auction - Donated Items</h2>` with an intro line "The following items have been donated by our members." A "Printed: `<date/time>`" line was added and then removed again per a direct follow-up ("remove printed date and time from form").
- **Done button behavior**: originally `window.close()` with a `setTimeout` fallback to `location.href='index.html'` (matching `add-item.php`'s Done button, for the case where the tab wasn't opened via `window.open()` and can't be closed by script). Simplified to **`window.close()` only** per explicit request ("done should closed form") — this page is always reached directly by URL, so the index.html fallback wasn't wanted.
- **Floating card layout**: "make form floating page" — clarified via `AskUserQuestion` (user picked **"Card with shadow"**) to mean a centered white card (rounded corners, `box-shadow`, `max-width:700px`) floating over a light-gray page background, matching a common modern-form aesthetic. `@media print` strips the background/shadow/border-radius and expands the card to full width so the printed page doesn't waste ink on decoration that only makes sense on screen.

### Gotcha for future sessions: two `AskUserQuestion` clarifications were needed this session
Two requests in a row ("make form modular", "make form floating page") were ambiguous enough on their own that guessing wrong would have meant redoing the work — both were disambiguated with `AskUserQuestion` before implementing, rather than guessing. If a short, vague styling request comes in for this page again, it's worth pattern-matching against this history before assuming what it means.

### 3. `test.html` updated to match, confirmed green
Added one new suite, **`starting-bid-list.php — standalone Starting Bid List page (v4.8 session)`** (9 assertions), covering: the standalone/no-login page itself, the server-side `sam_store` data source, final column order, the Starting Bid formula (reserve-or-percentage, matching the bid-sheet convention), the nowrap columns, the header text change, the floating-card layout, portrait print sizing, and the Done button's close-only behavior. (Suite name says "v4.8" — written before the checkpoint version number was decided; the actual shipped version is v5.0. Harmless, but if a future session is grepping `test.html` by version number, note the mismatch.)

No stale assertions needed fixing — the in-app popup button that was briefly added to `index.html` and then removed left no net trace requiring a test update.

Deployed via `.\deploy.ps1 test.html`, then **confirmed green by the user** at https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/test.html before the v5.0 checkpoint proceeded.

### 4. Checkpoint v5.0 (major version bump)
The user explicitly asked to bump to **5.0** (not a minor bump) — done via `.\bump-version.ps1 -Major` mid-session, ahead of the formal `/ETCCSAMCheckpoint` invocation. The checkpoint skill correctly detected the version was already bumped and did not double-bump.

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v4.7)

Short, incremental session driven by the user reviewing the live Donated Items screen after the v4.6 checkpoint and flagging two follow-on issues. Nothing here was requested up front — it was found live, in order:

### 1. Removed the orphaned Add Item modal (resolves prior open item #3)
The v4.6 session had switched "+ Add Item" to open `add-item.php` in a new tab, leaving the old in-app modal (`#add-item-modal`) and its three functions (`openAddItemModal()`, `closeAddItemModal()`, `saveAddItemModal()`) orphaned but not deleted, per the project's "flag, don't delete" convention. This session confirmed via grep that nothing else in `index.html` referenced them, then deleted the modal's `<div>` block and all three functions outright.

### 2. Real bug — Donor Name overflow bleeding into Donor Email column
**Symptom reported (via screenshot):** the Donor Email cell for a long-donor-name row ("Wilderness Trail Distillery, Attn. Grayson Yaden") showed visually garbled/overlapping text. First assumed to be a data problem (bad paste, hidden Unicode bidi characters) or a screenshot/tooltip artifact — the user then confirmed via Edit mode that the underlying data was completely clean (`Grayson.Yaden@campari.com`), which ruled that out.

**Root cause, found by comparing sibling `<td>` styling:** in `refreshItemsTable()` (`index.html`), the Description and Category `<td>`s explicitly set `white-space:normal;word-break:break-word;vertical-align:top`, but the Donor Name and Donor Email `<td>`s (originally two lines down) had no such style — so under `table-layout:fixed`, a long Donor Name overflowed past its column's fixed width and visually overlapped the Donor Email cell next to it. This wasn't a data bug or a screenshot artifact at all; it only became visible once a sufficiently long donor name/address was entered (the `add-item.php` workflow introduced in v4.6 made long addresses common for the first time).

**Fix:** added the same `white-space:normal;word-break:break-word;vertical-align:top` styling to the Donor Name and Donor Email `<td>`s in `refreshItemsTable()`. Also widened both columns in `#items-table`'s `<colgroup>` (Donor Name 140px→260px in two steps per user follow-up request; Donor Email 190px→260px), bumping the table's `min-width` from 1576px→1766px to match.

### 3. Real bug — Donor Name/Email edit-mode inputs clipped long text
Once the *display* mode wrapped correctly, the *edit* mode (triggered by clicking "Edit") still used single-line `<input type="text">` elements for Donor Name and Donor Email in `editItemByNumber()`, which clip/scroll long values instead of wrapping — inconsistent with Description, which already used a `<textarea>`. Changed both to `<textarea>`, matching Description's pattern. This required a follow-on fix in `saveItemEdit()`: it read the new values via `querySelector('input')`, which no longer matched anything once the elements became `<textarea>`s (would have silently kept stale values on save) — updated to `querySelector('textarea')` for both fields.

### 4. `test.html` updated to match, confirmed green
- Corrected the now-stale v4.6-session assertion that claimed `#add-item-modal`/`openAddItemModal()` "still exist in the DOM but are no longer wired to any button" — now notes they were fully removed in this session.
- Added a new suite, `Donated Items table — orphaned Add Item modal removed, columns widened, donor overflow fixed (v4.7 session)`, covering all three fixes above.
- Deployed via `.\deploy.ps1 test.html`, then **confirmed green by the user** at https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/test.html before the checkpoint proceeded.

## What was accomplished this session (checkpoint v4.6)

This was a long, iterative session driven entirely by incremental UI/UX requests against the Step 1 screen and `add-item.php`, plus two real bugs discovered and fixed along the way. Summarized in the order the underlying *design* ended up in, not the literal chat order (which zig-zagged through several false starts — see "Design detours" below).

### 1. `deploy.ps1` — cache-busting on every deploy
Added `Update-CacheBust()`: stamps a fresh `?v=<epoch-seconds>` query string onto the four static asset links in `index.html` (`css/table.css`, `css/toolbar.css`, `js/table.js`, `js/toolbar.js`), replacing any existing `?v=...` rather than stacking (idempotent, same pattern as `Update-Version`'s deploy-date stamp). Wired into both the single-file (`.\deploy.ps1 index.html`) and full-deploy code paths, alongside `Update-Version`. Purpose: force browsers to fetch fresh CSS/JS instead of a stale cached copy after every deploy.

### 2. Step 1 — "Item Load" → "Donated Items" screen overhaul
The single biggest change this session. Final end state:
- **Renamed everywhere**: page header, Home screen workflow card (title + subtitle "View donated items"), the `screenNames` map used by `navigate()`, and the in-app User Manual's Step 1 section all now say "Donated Items" instead of "Item Load"/"Load Item Emails".
- **Gmail email-scan workflow retired from view, not deleted.** The Gmail connection status strip, "no client ID" warning, and the Inbox Emails card (Scan Emails / View All / Delete All, `#email-table`) are now wrapped in a `display:none` container. They could not be removed outright: several `document.getElementById('btn-scan').addEventListener(...)`-style calls elsewhere have **no null-guard**, so deleting the elements would throw at script load and break the whole page. `#btn-load-items` ("Update Items") is hidden the same way, for the same reason.
- **The separate "Donated Items" modal (`#donated-items-modal`) was removed entirely** — it was a short-lived design from earlier this session (a full-screen overlay mirroring Loaded Items, with its own checkbox/bulk-delete UI) that got superseded once the user clarified they wanted the *existing* Loaded Items table itself to carry that behavior, not a separate view. `openDonatedItemsModal()`, `closeDonatedItemsModal()`, `renderDonatedItemsTable()`, `selectAllDonatedItemRows()`, `deleteCheckedDonatedItems()`, and the `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_DONATED` column map are all gone. The original `#items-table`/`#items-tbody` (card header now says "Donated Items", was "Loaded Items") carries the checkbox column and bulk delete directly.
- **Checkbox column + bulk delete on the one remaining table**: every row has a `.item-row-check` checkbox (`data-item-number="..."`); a header "check all" checkbox (`#items-check-all-th`) toggles all rows via `selectAllItemRows(checked)`. **Gotcha discovered and fixed**: `TableKit.init()` rebuilds every `<th>`'s contents on init, which wiped this checkbox out on every `refreshItemsTable()` call (same issue the View All modal already had to work around). Fixed by re-injecting the checkbox into the header cell immediately after `TableKit.init(document.getElementById('items-table'))` runs.
- **Per-row Delete button removed** — Actions column is now Edit-only (+ conditional View when a scanned-email match exists, a vestige of the old workflow, harmless). Deletion is now bulk-only via a **Delete Item** button (`deleteCheckedItems()`), which collects checked `data-item-number`s, confirms once, filters them out, saves, and cleans up any orphaned winner records — mirrors what `deleteItemByNumber()` already did per-row.
- **"Date Loaded" column removed** entirely — from the `<colgroup>`/`<thead>`, from `refreshItemsTable()`'s row template, and from `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`'s column-index map (shifted left by one: `category:3, desc:4, value:5, reserve:6, donorName:7, donorEmail:8, donorPhone:9, actions:10`). Table is now 12 columns (was 13, including the checkbox).
- **"View Categories" and "View All" buttons removed** from the toolbar (functions still exist, just unused here — `showViewAll` is still called elsewhere for emails/bid-sheets).
- **"Delete All" removed, replaced with a "🖨 Print" button** (`printDonatedItemsList()`) — opens a print-friendly list of all donated items via the same `openPrintWindow()` pattern already used by `printBiddersList()`/`printPaymentTable()`/etc. (`deleteAllItems()` is still defined but now unused.)
- **"Check All" / "Uncheck All" toolbar buttons removed** — the header checkbox is now the only toggle-all control (added originally alongside the buttons, then the buttons were removed once the header checkbox worked correctly).
- **"+ Add Item" now opens `add-item.php` in a new tab** (`window.open('add-item.php', '_blank')`) instead of the in-app modal — see open item #3 above re: the now-orphaned modal.
- **`add-item.php`'s "Cancel" button relabeled "Done"**, and its behavior changed from "just reload the same blank form" to `window.close(); setTimeout(() => location.href='index.html', 150);` — tries to close the tab (it was opened via script, so this works), falling back to navigating to `index.html` if the browser refuses.

### 3. Real bug #1 — multi-tab data loss (add-item.php inserts silently erased)
**Symptom reported:** an item added via the `add-item.php` form didn't show up in the app, even after navigating away and back.

**Root cause, found by tracing the actual save/sync code** (not by guessing): `navigate()` always calls `persistItemLoadScreenToDB()` when leaving the item-load screen, which does a **full overwrite** (`DB.saveItems()` → `save_items` action → deletes and re-inserts every row for that auction, in both the SQL `items` table and the `sam_store` key-value blob) using whatever items array is currently in the browser's memory. If `add-item.php` (now opened in a separate tab) inserted an item while the original SAM tab still held an older in-memory copy, switching back to that tab and navigating *anywhere* would push the stale array back out — silently erasing the item `add-item.php` had just written. This risk was actually already flagged in `add-item.php`'s own header comment, written back when Add Item only had an in-app-modal path with no separate-tab conflict — switching Add Item to open in its own tab (this session) is what made the risk real.

**Fix:** the app now re-syncs from the database automatically whenever the tab regains focus, reusing the existing `PageVisibilityManager.init()` `visibilitychange` handler (previously only used for session-timeout detection). Its "page visible again, session still valid" branch now also calls `syncFromKeyValueDB()`, then `refreshItemsTable()`/`refreshMetrics()` if the Donated Items screen is currently active — so switching back from the `add-item.php` tab refreshes the in-memory copy *before* any subsequent navigation can push a stale version back out.

### 4. Real bug #2 — Reserve Amount silently hidden when it had a "$" prefix
**Symptom reported:** after adding an item via `add-item.php`, its Reserve field wasn't populating in the table.

**Root cause:** `add-item.php`'s client-side `formatCurrency()` prepends a `$` to the Reserve Amount before submission (e.g. `"$75"`). Four separate render sites decided whether to show the Reserve column using a bare `parseFloat(item.reserve_amount) > 0` — and `parseFloat("$75")` returns `NaN` in JavaScript (it does not skip a leading `$`), so any reserve value carrying that prefix was silently treated as blank/zero. Items loaded the old way (Gmail scan, plain numeric reserve) never had a `$` prefix, which is exactly why this bug went unnoticed until `add-item.php` became the primary entry point this session.

**Fix:** switched all four sites — `refreshItemsTable()` (Donated Items table), `printDonatedItemsList()`, the Announce Winners table, and the View All-equivalent render path — plus the bid-sheet's `hasReserve` flag (governs whether the Reserve info box/column appears on printed bid sheets) to use the existing `parseMoney()` helper, which already strips `$`/`,` before parsing.

### 5. Total Value metric — reserve-or-value fallback
Per explicit user request: `refreshMetrics()`'s Total Value calculation now sums, per item, the **Reserve** amount if it's set and non-zero, otherwise the **Value** amount (previously always summed Value regardless of Reserve).

### 6. Settings screen — Email Field Mapping card and Clear Emails button removed
- **Email Field Mapping card removed entirely**: the card, `renderFieldMapTable()`/`editFieldMapRow()`/`saveFieldMapRow()`/`removeFieldMapRow()`, the `LOADED_ITEMS_COL`/`SELECT_BY_OPTIONS` constants, its `#field-map-table` CSS, and its User Manual mention are all gone. `DB.getFieldMap()`/`saveFieldMap()` (the data-layer functions) were left alone, since the still-present (orphaned) Gmail-scan email parser calls `DB.getFieldMap()`.
- **Gotcha caught before it shipped**: `renderFieldMapTable()` was called unconditionally on every Settings-screen load — leaving that call in place after removing its target table would have thrown (`tbody.innerHTML` on `null`) and broken the rest of Settings' load sequence (auction dropdown, favicon, settings-password field, etc.). Removed the call.
- **"Clear Emails" button removed** from Developer Tools, along with its `document.getElementById('btn-clear-emails').addEventListener(...)` call (same unguarded-null-ref risk, same fix).
- **Gmail OAuth card explicitly kept** — user was asked directly and confirmed keeping it, since it's still load-bearing for Announce Winners → Email Winners (see open item #4 above).

### Design detours worth knowing about (in case they look like unfinished work)
- Early in the session, "replace the Item Load form with the donated items form" went through **three rounds of clarification** before landing on the final design — the user first meant the Donated Items screen's manual-entry fields (not `add-item.php`, not the old Gmail-parsed fields), which is why the very first version of this change made the Add Item modal (already existing but previously unwired) the primary entry point, *before* a later request switched it to open `add-item.php` in a new tab instead.
- A short-lived intermediate design added a **separate** "Donated Items" modal (mirroring Loaded Items with its own checkbox/bulk-delete UI) before the user clarified they wanted that behavior folded directly into the existing Loaded Items table instead, with no separate modal. If a future session finds this confusing in git history, that's why — it was corrected within the same session, not left half-done.

## Checkpoint procedure (unchanged, still the standing convention)

1. Update `test.html` for whatever changed (skip if nothing test-relevant changed).
2. `.\deploy.ps1 test.html` if it changed.
3. **Ask the user** to manually run https://etccapps.com/apps/sam/test.html and report pass/fail (automated running is broken — see "Known issues" below). Do not proceed until they say it's green.
4. Once green: `.\bump-version.ps1` (minor bump by default; `-Major` flag for major bumps) **if not already bumped earlier in the session** — check the footer span first, don't double-bump. Then `.\deploy.ps1 index.html` (and any other changed files individually).
5. `git add` the changed files (never `git add -A`), commit with a `Checkpoint vX.Y: <short description>` message, `git push`. Commit and push **without asking** once tests are confirmed green.
6. Report the commit hash, version, and live URL back to the user.

Deploying individual files (`.\deploy.ps1 <file>`) happens continuously after every code change, **without being asked** — separate from the commit/checkpoint step. Never commit on every deploy — only at an explicit "checkpoint". Bare "test" (no other words) means **update** the regression suite only — never run it yourself.

**A bare "commit, and push"** (or invoking the separate, lighter-weight `ETCCCheckpoint` skill — a global agent skill, not part of this repo, shared with the CarShow project) skips the version bump and the test-green gate entirely. Use judgment on which the user actually means.

**Known issue #1 (still open):** automated regression test running from a Claude Code session is blocked — a bot-check/403 page intercepts any CDP-automated browser hitting the live site (Hostinger-hosted; earlier write-ups of this doc misattributed this to "Cloudflare" — this project has no Cloudflare in front of it, correct that if you see it elsewhere). Workaround: the user runs the suite manually and reports pass/fail verbally.

**Known issue #2 (RESOLVED as of 2026-08-31, v6.7/v6.8 session):** `deploy.ps1`'s FTP upload used to run via `curl.exe` and would intermittently fail (`curl: (56) response reading failed` or `curl: (18) ... got 450`) — with the file sometimes not actually updating on the server despite (or alongside) the reported failure, or despite a reported *success*. Root cause identified this session: `curl.exe` on this machine uses the Windows Schannel TLS backend, which has a bug against this Hostinger FTPS server — the transfer completes fully but curl can't read the server's final control-channel response. **`deploy.ps1` no longer uses curl at all** — `Deploy-File` now uses `System.Net.FtpWebRequest`, verified working across single-file and full-deploy modes with real `Last-Modified`-header checks. See open item #14 above for full detail. If deploy failures resurface, they are a *different* issue now — don't reach for the old curl/Hostinger-File-Manager workaround by reflex.

## Architecture notes not yet in CLAUDE.md

- **`rowCheckboxOffset(tr)`** (`index.html`, module-scope, near `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`): returns `1` if a row's first `<td>` contains any `<input type="checkbox">`, else `0`. Used by `editItemByNumber()`/`saveItemEdit()` so cell-index lookups stay correct regardless of which table (Loaded/Donated Items' now-permanent checkbox, or View All's optional one) is being edited. Since Donated Items' checkbox is now permanent (not conditional), `ITEM_EDIT_COLS_MAIN`'s indices are consistently "un-shifted" positions with `off` always adding the checkbox offset on top for that table.
- **`VIEW_ALL_SELECTABLE.items.stripLeadingCol`** (`index.html`, `showViewAll()`): the View All modal clones `#items-table`'s rows and normally adds its *own* selection checkbox. Since Loaded/Donated Items now has a permanent leading checkbox of its own, this flag strips the source table's own checkbox cell/header from the clone first (guarded to skip the single-cell empty-state row) so the two don't stack into a doubled, misaligned column.
- **`PageVisibilityManager`** (`index.html`): originally only handled session-timeout-on-return-from-hidden. Its "page visible again" branch now also re-syncs from the database (`syncFromKeyValueDB()`) and refreshes the Donated Items screen if active — see "Real bug #1" above. Any future feature that opens app-adjacent pages in a separate tab (like `add-item.php`) benefits from this automatically; no per-feature wiring needed.
- **`deploy.ps1`'s `Update-CacheBust()`** (new this session): stamps `?v=<epoch-seconds>` onto `css/table.css`, `css/toolbar.css`, `js/table.js`, `js/toolbar.js` in `index.html` at deploy time. Idempotent — re-running replaces the existing `?v=...` rather than appending a duplicate.
- **`add-item.php`'s "Done" button** now does `window.close()` first, falling back to `location.href='index.html'` after 150ms if the tab wasn't closable (e.g. reached directly rather than via `window.open()` from the app).
